# MCP Calc Tools Server Implementation Plan

## 1. Create "uvx" Command

### Approach
We'll create a dedicated "uvx" command for the MCP server. The "uvx" prefix suggests using the `uv` package manager, which is already referenced in the project.

### Tasks
1. Create a new entry point in pyproject.toml for "uvx-mcp-calc"
2. Modify the CLI implementation to support cleaner execution
3. Ensure the command runs the server without cluttering workspaces
   - Use isolated environments or temporary directories if needed
   - Clean up after execution

## 2. Package Configuration Updates

### Approach
Make the package properly configurable for distribution and use with Roo.

### Tasks
1. Update dependency on mcp-sdk
   - Replace local path with a proper PyPI reference or git repository
2. Update pyproject.toml with more metadata
   - Add repository URL
   - Add author information
   - Add keywords
3. Ensure the package structure follows best practices
   - Verify all necessary files are included
   - Confirm imports work correctly

## 3. Documentation Updates

### Approach
Provide clear, comprehensive documentation for users and developers.

### Tasks
1. Update README.md
   - Add detailed installation instructions
   - Add usage examples with the new "uvx" command
   - Document how to use with Roo
2. Add examples
   - Show how to integrate with other applications
   - Demonstrate typical use cases
3. Add developer documentation
   - How to contribute
   - How to extend the server

## 4. Testing

### Approach
Verify the server works correctly and can be used with Roo.

### Tasks
1. Test installation from scratch
2. Test server functionality
3. Test integration with Roo
4. Document any issues and solutions

## Implementation Timeline

1. Package configuration updates - Immediate
2. "uvx" command implementation - Immediate
3. Documentation updates - After implementation
4. Testing - Final phase

## Success Criteria

- The "uvx" command works without cluttering workspaces
- The package can be installed and used by other applications
- The server works correctly with Roo's MCP tool server
- Documentation is clear and comprehensive
